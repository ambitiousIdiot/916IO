I would like this process to be automated using python with pandas by building on this frame:
import tkinter
from tkinter import filedialog
import customtkinter
import pandas as pd

customtkinter.set_appearance_mode("dark")
customtkinter.set_default_color_theme("dark-blue")

root = customtkinter.CTk()
root.geometry("600x450")  # Adjusted for better visual layout

def process_excel_file(file_path):
    # Load the Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
    
    # Identify rows that match the given conditions using the provided column names
    rows_to_delete = df[(df['Component Name'].str.contains("M916_IO", na=False)) & 
                        (df['Description'].str.contains("ControlListSelector", na=False))]

    # Drop these rows
    df = df.drop(rows_to_delete.index)

    # Save the modified dataframe back to the same Excel file
    df.to_excel(file_path, index=False)
    print(f"Processed file: {file_path}")

def select_excel_file():
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(title="Select Excel File", filetypes=[("Excel Files", "*.xls;*.xlsx")])
    if file_path:
        process_excel_file(file_path)

frame = customtkinter.CTkFrame(master=root)
frame.pack(pady=20, padx=60, fill="both", expand=True)

# Placing the main label at the top using grid
label = customtkinter.CTkLabel(master=frame, text="Please select card types for each slot:")
label.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=10, pady=10)

# Option values for the dropdown menus
options = ["No Card", "16 Digital Input", "16 Digital Output", "32 Digital Input", "32 Digital Output", "16 Analog Input", "16 Analog Output", "32 Analog Input", "32 Analog Output"]

# Creating labels and dropdown menus for each card
menus = []
for i in range(4):
    card_label = customtkinter.CTkLabel(master=frame, text=f"Card {i+1}")
    card_label.grid(row=i+1, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="e")
    
    menu = customtkinter.CTkOptionMenu(master=frame, values=options)
    menu.grid(row=i+1, column=1, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="w")
    menus.append(menu)

# Creating the button at the bottom
button = customtkinter.CTkButton(master=frame, text="Select Excel File", command=select_excel_file)
button.grid(row=5, column=0, columnspan=2, pady=20, padx=10)  # Place the button at the bottom

root.mainloop()


To add the data we need to copy the Server column data (this can be taken from any row in the column, they are all identical). This should be stored in a variable as it will be used many times in the program. then is the Component type which can be stored in a variable as "Graphic Display". Then the Component Name can be stored in a variable as "M916_IO". None of these items will change over the course of the program so they can all be stored in variables. The Description will sequentially increase. It will start with ControlListSelector1.0.St_Caption, ControlListSelector1.1.St_Caption, ControlListSelector1.2.St_Caption ... ControlListSelector1.255.St_Caption then it will continue to ControlListSelector2.0.St_Caption to ControlListSelector2.255.St_Caption, then ControlListSelector3.0.St_Caption to ControlListSelector3.255.St_Caption and finally ControlListSelector4.0.St_Caption to ControlListSelector4.255.St_Caption. in total there will be 1024 of these items in the final document. After this the en-US column will need to be dynamically generated from the copypasta file as described before.

in summary, the output document should have 1024 rows inserted (at the bottom of the remaining data in the document) with the following content:
[Server],[Component Type],[Component Name],[Description],[en-US]
The [Server] column should match the rest of that column's content found in the rest of the document.
The [Component Type] column should be "Graphic Display".
The [Component Name] column should be "M916_IO".
The [Description] column should be four sequentially increasing sets of ControlListSelectorY.X.St_Caption with each of the four sets of Y containing 0-255 for X. These Y values correspond to Digital/Analog Inputs/Outputs with 1 being digital inputs, 2 being Digital Outputs, 3 being Analog Inputs, and 4 being Analog Outputs.
The [en-US] column should contain a long set of data copied from the copypasta file. The data is currently arranged in a coulumn as it would appear in the output document. Depending on the set of cards selected and the number of cards selected, the number and placement of this data will change. For more information on this, ask for elaboration. This will be the most complex part of the program.
